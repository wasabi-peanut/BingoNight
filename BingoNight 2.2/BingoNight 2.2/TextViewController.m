When you add a new scheme, it uses the current scheme as the base. Therefore, if you want to make an edit to the default Red scheme, add a new scheme while Red is selected.

You often will want these to have a faded or darkened look so players can easily distinguish between what has been called and what is left. You can also change the Bingo Letters, which are the letters B-I-N-G-O that appear aside the number rows in the grid. Remember to distinguish these from the background color.Your changes will display in the sample grid on this page.\nnYou can also change the name of the game. You will see a yellow box around the display, which means editing is enabled. The name appears above the grid on the game play display.

If the app cannot find the selected song, no sound will play.\n\nAlso, think about how long each checking period will take when you choose a song. For example, checking if a card had a row of five takes much less time then checking if a perimeter or the entire card is filled.
